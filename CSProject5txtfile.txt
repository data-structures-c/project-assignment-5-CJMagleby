For my assignment I ran 50 trials of four different sorting algorithms, and then ran 4 different samples ranging from 1 thousand to 4 thousand and recorded the results. Merge sort was clearly the fastest, because it runs at nlog(n) instead of n^2 like the rest of the algorithms. However looking at the standard deviation, despite being the slowest, bubble sort had the lowest variance of any of the sorting algorithms when compared to it's mean. Despite being slightly more consistent, taking a high variance but faster sorting algorithm would clearly be the better choice.
